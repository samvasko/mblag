_Scaffolding for markdown blog_

We are in era of static markdown-based blogs. So I made my own...
But this one is simple.In fact, It is so simple it can hardly be called functional right now. But that's the point. You are the person who is supposed to make it nice and useful.

This is made for people who want to make their own blog, without introductory cleanup.
To transform this seed into something nice, you will have to make your own CSS, Html and maybe touch some Ruby.

_If you make something nice of this please send me a link, I would very much like to see it_
